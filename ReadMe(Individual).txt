This assignment aims to help you practice multithreading and concurrent programming, network programming,
and graphical user interface components in Python. On the successful completion of this assignment,
you will also practice Python basics. Your main task in this assignment is to develop a client- server application
for a coffee shop based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
The client application will be used by both baristas and managers, and multiple barista panels and manager panels
should be able to be opened at the same time, so the server should be able to communicate with multiple clients at the
same time.
